# My Portfolio

## About the project

My Portfolio project is a Codecademy project made to practice HTML/CSS/JS. Its actually the first project in the Codecademy Fullstack career path that you actually use JS on a webpage. The Portfolio is about showing of the work that we already done to try to get a new job in the IT market. In my personnal case, that would come later and that the main reason why this project is incomplete and non-personnal. I will still keep it up to date as my coding skill grow and I realize more project.
